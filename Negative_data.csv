a2p1U000000RpJ0QAK,0011U00000ri8LHQAY,i found it odd that at my initial appt  it seemed that the doctor tried to discourage my using her as a primary care physician stating that for annual exams it would probably be ok but for more acute issues she would have limited availability due to her schedule at off site locations  she didn     t seem to be engaged during our discussion and actually yawned several times which did not bode well from my perspective  during my lab appointment the tech had an issue drawing blood from the initial poke and ended up having to get the rest from a second draw on my hand which i found unusual  after waiting over   weeks to hear from the doc re the lab results and or to be able to see the results online via your website  i em     d paladina and received a response saying they would have someone from the office contact me  i finally received a call and was told that the doctor hadn     t reviewed the results and that was why i hadn     t heard and why the results weren     t online but now she had and needed me to schedule an appt to come in and review the results  this is not the experience i expected based on the info provided by both eaton and paladina and i  it be using paladina in the future the receptionist was friendly and helpful lack of engagement by doctor  did not seem like she was interested in establishing a doctor patient partnership ,Negative

a2p4w000002O1ZaAAK,0014w000031qc0mAAA,i got in quickly and my tick bite was assessed and prophylaxis was offered per cdc guidelines the nurse practitioner did not seem to appreciate that i was asking so many questions or questioning the dosage of antibiotics  i used the term  quot i am a little freaked out quot  because i had been bitten by a tick and my arm was in pain from my shoulder to my palm  with redness and swelling under the skin that was about the size of a half dollar  i have underlying hashimoto     s disease which usually means my body reacts to infections slightly differently than a normal person     s  which concerns me  even though most medical doctors find this to be an insignificant concern  my provider was having her own difficulty with a medical issue  was having spasms and couldn     t walk temporarily   her face indicated she was in pain  however  my questions seemed to annoy her and she did not like the fact that i was asking questions about having a longer dose of antibiotics  her tone of voice changed to that of being short with me  borderline rude  i finally put on my coat and told her that i did not appreciate her tone of voice with me and that perhaps if she was experiencing her own medical issues than perhaps she should not have come in to work that day    i recognize that the tick was not swollen with blood or in my arm for more than    hours  however the reaction that i was having was painful and continues to be painful today and is of concern to me and my family  though the chance of contracting a disease from the bite is minimal  there is still a small possibility and that concerns me  especially because i have existing autoimmune problems  so yes  this tick bit  quot freaked me out quot  and i was anxious about it but instead of being nicely reassured  i was talked down to in a rude manner  the np saying  quot i     ve told you this twice already  quot    maya angelou said that people may forget what you do or say but they never forget how they made you feel  i left the office feeling worse than when i came in  i was freaked out and anxious for a good reason  my blood pressure was high  no one should be made to feel bad about being anxious after getting a bad tick bite  especially in a medical setting where compassion and empathy is paramount  it just seems like the nurse practitioner was unable to provide this on that day due to her own pain issues  i have never had a problem with this provider in the past so perhaps this was just out of character for her that day due to her own pain ,Negative
